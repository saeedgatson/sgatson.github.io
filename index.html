<p>If testing drives you nutty because it mostly manual, regression cycles take forever, and the Test teams always playing catchup. <em>We need to do coffee - ASAP!</em></p>

<p>If your startup is growing like crazy and needs to scale its testing efforts. <em>Then hit me up.</em></p>

<p>Maybe you’re in the tech space or just feel that we could be great friends, <em>then we need to do coffee too.</em></p>

<a id="how-it-all-started" class="anchor" href="#how-it-all-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it all started.</h3>

<p><strong>I'm A Geek With Jock Tendencies</strong></p>

<p>I was finishing up my Computer Science Degree at Cal State East Bay back in 2011. Trading my time between writing code, and grabbing rebounds for the colleges Division II Basketball team.</p>

<p>So I'm watching some random action movie with a beautiful girl <em>(now wife)</em>, and started noticing something was off in almost every scene.</p>

<p>The car door in the background was open, next cut it’s closed. Bad guys magically falling down without being touched. My wife, wasn’t catching any of this. She was amazed the first 2 times, a little freaked out at 4, and annoyed by 6.</p>

<p>So I stopped talking around then. Quietly found a ton of “bugs” that day. Didn’t know it at the time but a testers seed was starting to grow.</p>

<p>For over 4 years that tree has grown, and I've helping startups success with test automation ever senses.</p>

<h3>
<a id="so-what-exactly-do-i-do" class="anchor" href="#so-what-exactly-do-i-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So what exactly do I do?</h3>

<p>Build testing frameworks &amp; write automated test. These are then spun across your application &amp; used as part of your build process.</p>

<p>I’ve used technologies like C# .Net, Java, Selenium Web-driver, Jenkins; And are open to new languages and frameworks.
If you want, I can manage the process for you, or you could work directly with them. Whatever it takes to “get shit done.”</p>

<p><strong>What do you believe?</strong></p>

<p><em>Testing equal learning</em>. By being life-long learners we can continually improve our work. It’s that simple.
And that powerful.</p>
