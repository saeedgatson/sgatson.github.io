{"name":"Saeed Gatson","tagline":"Welcome To My Little Corner Of The Web","body":"## Your QA Expert, Automation Engineer, or Software Developer In Test\r\n\r\nHi, I’m **Saeed Gatson**. I’m a Software Developer in Test (SDET) living in the San Francisco Bay area. Also the author of a the software testing blog called [Testsmith](http://testsmith.com).\r\n\r\n### My specialities are:\r\n\r\n   * Architecture and Design of Test Automation Frameworks.\r\n   * Helping companies scale testing efforts.\r\n   * Automating manual test scripts.\r\n   * Testing API's & Web Services.\r\n\r\n### Should we work together? Is it love at first sight?\r\n\r\nIf testing drives you nutty because it mostly manual, regression cycles take forever, and the Test teams always playing catchup. *We need to do coffee - ASAP!*\r\n\r\nIf your startup is growing like crazy and needs to scale its testing efforts. *Then hit me up.*\r\n\r\nMaybe you’re in the tech space or just feel that we could be great friends, *then we need to do coffee too.*\r\n\r\n### How it all started.\r\n\r\n**I'm A Geek With Jock Tendencies**\r\n\r\nI was finishing up my Computer Science Degree at Cal State East Bay back in 2011. Trading my time between writing code, and grabbing rebounds for the colleges Division II Basketball team.\r\n\r\nSo I'm watching some random action movie with a beautiful girl *(now wife)*, and started noticing something was off in almost every scene.\r\n\r\nThe car door in the background was open, next cut it’s closed. Bad guys magically falling down without being touched. My wife, wasn’t catching any of this. She was amazed the first 2 times, a little freaked out at 4, and annoyed by 6.\r\n\r\nSo I stopped talking around then. Quietly found a ton of “bugs” that day. Didn’t know it at the time but a testers seed was starting to grow.\r\n\r\nFor over 4 years that tree has grown, and I've helping startups success with test automation ever senses.\r\n\r\n### So what exactly do I do?\r\n\r\nBuild testing frameworks & write automated test. These are then spun across your application & used as part of your build process.\r\n\r\nI’ve used technologies like C# .Net, Java, Selenium Web-driver, Jenkins; And are open to new languages and frameworks.\r\nIf you want, I can manage the process for you, or you could work directly with them. Whatever it takes to “get shit done.”\r\n\r\n**What do you believe?**\r\n\r\n*Testing equal learning*. By being life-long learners we can continually improve our work. It’s that simple.\r\nAnd that powerful.\r\n\r\n### Things I've done.\r\n\r\nOn my blog [Testsmith](http://testsmith.com) I share my experiences to *help startups grow by using test automation*.\r\nThere you can find post like: [Why Your Startup Needs Automated Test](http://testsmith.com/why-your-startup-needs-automated-test/), [Habits Of Highly Effective Testers](http://testsmith.com/habits-of-highly-effective-testers/), & [Tip For Product Owners Planning To Test An MVP](http://testsmith.com/tip-for-product-owners-planning-to-test-an-mvp/).\r\n\r\nMost of my coding projects are on [Github](https://github.com/sgatson). If you’re looking for something specific contact me and I’ll send over some other code samples.\r\n\r\n### What have *other* sweet folks said about me.\r\n\r\n*I'm every Developers favorite person in test.*\r\n\r\nPeople say I'm a quick learner, and they really enjoy working with me because I'm easy to get along with.\r\n\r\nI’ve been recommended on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/pub/saeed-gatson/27/4b2/277/), & you can also contact me for other references.\r\n\r\n### How to get in contact with me.\r\n\r\nFor a quick chat with no salesy talk, just learning about your business, a  lot of laughs and stories about the things I’ve learned. Catch me on my cell (415) 623 0676 or shot an email to saeedgatson@gmail.com - looking forward to it.\r\n\r\nFor quick witted pros about testing & what I'm into, follow [@saeedgatson](http://twitter.com/saeedgatson) on Twitter.","google":"UA-22783971-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
